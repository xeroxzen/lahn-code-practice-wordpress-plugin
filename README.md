## Custom WordPress plugin for purchasing airtime and bundles.

### Plugin location.
The files to the plugin are located in the wp_content directory [https://github.com/xeroxzen/lahn-code-practice-wordpress-plugin/tree/main/wp-content/plugins/buyAirtimeAndBundles]. The exact URL to the php file for the plugin is directly underneath

[custom_airtime_bundle_purchase](https://github.com/xeroxzen/lahn-code-practice-wordpress-plugin/blob/6a3ab74253ac88f65b0e7061d69c1193af8c9893/wp-content/plugins/buyAirtimeAndBundles/buyAirtimeAndBundles.php#L51)

### How it works
The plugin works the same way a popup does, it's activated by an onClick JavaScript action that is embedded in a button that is located in the site's footer. Upon clicking the button a popup appears and the user can proceed to purchase airtime for any network of their choice as well as Econet bundles.
